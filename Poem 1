Down in South Kensington, you will find
A little campus with brains inside.
All thinking hard with hearts aglow,
trying to decipher why and how
Mother nature crafts her show.

As if Syn Bio weren't enough
learned minds on every hand,
were setting coursework, some of it planned
To be a Challenge! Bold and rough.
Between you and I, I'm out of puff.
